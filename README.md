# Snyk Documentation

## Getting set up

1. Pull down the repo
2. In the command line, navigate to the repo's folder and run `bundle install`
3. If there are no errors, run `jekyll serve`
4. Go to http://localhost:4000/docs in your browser

### Saving drafts

If you want to preview a file but not let the changes show on production, add this line to the YAML front-matter:

```
---
draft: true
---
```

This will add a "draft" label and background colour.

### Hide a title

To not show the title (such as on a landing section), add this line to the YAML front-matter:

```
---
title: ""
---
```
