title: Switching between organisations
---

**On snyk.io:**
* Choose the organisation you want from the drop-down menu in the top navigation. 
* If you add projects on snyk.io via GitHub integration, they will be added to the currently chosen organisation.

**In the Snyk CLI:**
* If you have only your default organisation, any projects you add or update by running `snyk wizard` or `snyk monitor` will be automatically associated with your default organisation. 
* If you have more than one organisation, you can configure which one projects should be associated with by running `snyk config set org=orgname”.
* If you would like to override this global configuration for individual runs of `snyk wizard` or `snyk monitor`, run `snyk monitor --org=orgname` or `snyk wizard --org=orgname`.
