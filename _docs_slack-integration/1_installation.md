Don't like email? You can set up Slack to receive Snyk's alerts about new vulnerabilities that affect your projects, and about new upgrades or patches that have become available.

You'll get two alerts in Slack:

1: A newly disclosed vulnerability affects you

2: A new upgrade or patch is available for a vulnerability that you previously ignored or patched

![Slack Remediation Alert](http://res.cloudinary.com/snyk/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto,w_auto/v1474298547/Slack-Remediation-Alert.png)

To set it up, go to your 'Manage organisation' settings, and simply enter the Slack WebHook URL.
